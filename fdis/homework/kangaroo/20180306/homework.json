    "description": "Dear Families,\n\nSome Kangaroos presented their Rube Goldberg Machines today. Kindly see two of the best videos attached. \n\nEvery student is asked to present a video of his/ her Rube Goldberg machine that has 3-5 simple machines working together. Tomorrow is the last day to do so. Some of the students decided to make a better Rube Goldberg machine and present the video tomorrow, on March 6th.\n\nLooking forward to watching the remaining videos in class tomorrow. Please, send the video on a USB or via email: natalya_fdis@rambler.ru\n\nThank you for your support!\n\nSincerely,\nMs.L",
