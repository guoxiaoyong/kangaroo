    "description": "Dear Families,\n\nAs some of the students were done with Quarter 3 assessments today, they used their free time to work on 3D solar system or world map that we are going to work on in Quarter 4. Mr.Scott is going to post Taobao links for you to buy them and play with your child at home if you want to.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the students took leftovers they got while compiling the 3D items without asking me. We keep talking about items thet do not belong to us and that it is not ok to take anything that is not yours and distribute it among anyone just because it is not yours to begin with. kindly reinforce it at home. If your child took anything home or took what other students gave them without my permission, please, send it back to school tomorrow.\n\nAppreciated in advance.\n\nSincerely,\nMs.L",
