Please, write an email to natalya_fdis@rambler.ru if you or anyone from your family is NOT coming on Friday. It will allow us to set a job for your child to be busy with or get to sit with another family.\n\nIn case AQI is too high or it is raining, Kangaroos (both Families and children) move to Room A114 to enjoy picnic in our classroom.\n\nLooking forward to meeting lots of students dressed up as their favorite book characters. Your child should be ready to say a couple of facts about their character!\n\nYour continuous support is greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\nMs.L",
