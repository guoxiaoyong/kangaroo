I used scissors to cut the washed eggs open.\n\nPlease, note that this is not an obligation as it's not a TS topic now. It's fine if your child doesn't want to take part.\n\nFor those who want to, I am looking forward to planting with your child during play time at school this week!\n\nYour continuous support is always appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\nMs.L",

    "description": "Dear Families,\n\nWe started learning about light today. Students talked about luminous (give out light) and non-luminous objects, transparent (light can travel through) and opaque (stops the light) objects. Today Kangaroos had an experiment to find out what happens when the sun is blocked by an opaque object. \n\nEvery student is asked to bring a piece of transparent, a semi-transparent, and opaque material/ object to school this week. \n\nI have one torch in our class students could share. If you have a torch you could send to school and let your child have experiments with light till Friday, kindly do so.\n\nHere are the video links to the videos your child could re-watch at home:\n\nShadow | The Dr. Binocs Show | Educational Videos For Kids\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIGOT88Aqc\n\nLight | The Dr. Binocs Show | Learn Videos For Kids\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7yTlp4gBTI\n\nLight | Videos for Kids\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvKpqIS9k9Y\n\nYour support is appreciated at all times.\n\nSincerely,\nMs.L",
