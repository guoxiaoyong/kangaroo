DESCRIPTION:Dear parents\,\n\nWe are very happy that most parents are usin
 g Managebac to keep in touch with their Homeroom teachers through portfoli
 o.\nAt the same time\, here is a request from the school that please avoid
  clicking "Notify by email" when you reply any notes from the teacher on M
 anagebac because every teacher who has taught your kid will receive the re
 minder email that may not protect your kids' private matter. You can eithe
 r send a message on Wechat or write a short email to remind the homeroom t
 eacher to check your reply.\n\n我们很高兴家长们使用系统的功
 能与班主任老师保持联系。现在学校有一个新的要求，
 希望家长们在发布和回复班主任老师的消息时不要选择
 通过邮件提醒这一选项，为了保护你孩子的隐私也避免
 让其它与内容不相干的老师们收到通知。\n\nThank you for yo
 ur cooperation!\n谢谢大家的配合！\nES Dean's office\n小学主任

 s using a calculator\, i.e. 25 centimeters = 9.84 inches because 25 divide
 d by 2.54 equals 9.84 inches. If your child did not finish classwork\, the
