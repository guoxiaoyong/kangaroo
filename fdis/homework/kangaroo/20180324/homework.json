    "description": "Dear Families,\n\nAs one of the skills for Quarter 3 is to identify a way you can help improve at least your local community, we cannot help but take part in celebrating Earth Hour by switching electricity off on March 24 at 8:30 pm. Kindly support your child in having activities that do not require using electricity for one hour this Saturday. Please, take a photo of your child celebrating Earth Hour. Every student is asked to make a poster using the photo(s). A poster sample is attached.\n\nFor more information, please, use the link: \n\nhttps://www.earthhour.org/\n\nLooking forward in getting all the marvelous posters on March 26th!\n\nChange Climate Change Together :-)\n\nSincerely,\nMs.L",
