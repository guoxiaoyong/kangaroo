    "description": "Dear Families,\n\nFor the next two Fridays (March 9 and March 16) we will have some STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) activities. For these activities we ask that each student brings the following items on Friday (March 9, 2017):\n\n2 paper cups\n\n1 plastic bottle with a lid\n\n2 plastic bags (thin disposable bag for vegetables)\n\n5 rubber bands\n\n100 grams (handful) of either salt, rice, and/or dried beans\n\n1 cardboard box (for example a tissue box or shoe box)\n\n1 tin can (tea/ coffee can)\n\nKindly note that I have 2 measuring cups students could use in class tomorrow. If you have a measuring cup your child could take to school, please, send it as well. If not, they are available in class, but students will have to show patience.\n\nLooking forward to watching students work in groups to create a wonderful show using sound and light!\n\nSincerely,\nMs.L",
