## The Big Taking Photos Day (April 3)

Dear Families,



The Big Photo Day is coming: Kangaroo class photo, All School photo, and Individual photos. Each student will be asked to have a white top and a black bottom for the official whole school photo, and Kangaroos are going to pick the topic of our class photo theme this week for you to support them and have clothes ready on April 3rd.



Kindly keep in mind that it is a full School Day.



Your support is greatly appreciated at all times!



Sincerely,

Ms.L
