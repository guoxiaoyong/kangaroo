## An Orange Lamp

Dear Families,



Happy International Woman's Day!



Maybe your child could make an orange peel candle with your support to celebrate it :-)

## STEM Activities on Sound and Light

Dear Families,



For the next two Fridays (March 9 and March 16) we will have some STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) activities. For these activities we ask that each student brings the following items on Friday (March 9, 2017):



2 paper cups



1 plastic bottle with a lid



2 plastic bags (thin disposable bag for vegetables)



5 rubber bands



100 grams (handful) of either salt, rice, and/or dried beans



1 cardboard box (for example a tissue box or shoe box)



1 tin can (tea/ coffee can)



Kindly note that I have 2 measuring cups students could use in class tomorrow. If you have a measuring cup your child could take to school, please, send it as well. If not, they are available in class, but students will have to show patience.



Looking forward to watching students work in groups to create a wonderful show using sound and light!



Sincerely,

Ms.L

## Sound Travels through Air

Dear Families,



We are learning about Sound and how it travels. We are lucky that Rachel's video caught the flash of lightning and the clap of thunder afterwards. We need to find out how far away the storm was. If 5 seconds = 1 mile away or 3 seconds = 1 kilometer away, please, find the answer.



Have fun mixing Math and TS :-)



Sincerely,

Ms.L
