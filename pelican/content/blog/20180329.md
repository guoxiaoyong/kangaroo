## Volunteer to help out at home in a way that goes beyond what you are expected to do.

Dear Families,



Your child is going to come up with some activities to do to help out at home. Get ready to take photos as we need evidence :-)



Enjoy all the extra help from the bottom of your child's heart :-)



Kindly send evidence with captions describing what is happening in the photos as a poster to school.



Sincerely,

Ms.L
