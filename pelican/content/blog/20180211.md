## A Note for Managebac 

Dear parents,

We are very happy that most parents are using Managebac to keep in touch with their Homeroom teachers through portfolio.
At the same time, here is a request from the school that please avoid clicking "Notify by email" when you reply any notes from the teacher on Managebac because every teacher who has taught your kid will receive the reminder email that may not protect your kids' private matter. You can either send a message on Wechat or write a short email to remind the homeroom teacher to check your reply.

我们很高兴家长们使用系统的功能与班主任老师保持联系。现在学校有一个新的要求，希望家长们在发布和回复班主任老师的消息时不要选择通过邮件提醒这一选项，为了保护你孩子的隐私也避免让其它与内容不相干的老师们收到通知。

Thank you for your cooperation!
谢谢大家的配合！
