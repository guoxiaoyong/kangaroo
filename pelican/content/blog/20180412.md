Dear Families,



Here is a note that I got from Yodak hospital today:



Little Shi Xiaojing is now in Yodak Cardio-Thoracic Hospital.  She is a 1 year old girl from Anhui province who had cardiac catheritization yesterday.  She is doing really well and is already back on the ward.   Everything will be different now for both Shi Xiaojing and her family.  They are extremely relieved and happy how it has all turned out.  Thank you!



Have a great day!
