## Service Learning Week: May 21-25 Plan (draft)

Dear Families,



Kindly find the Service Learning Week plan (draft) attached. Small changes might be still made but here is the general plan:



May 21: BIOFarm Field Trip (could bring money to buy plants)

May 22: Chocolate Factory Field Trip (could bring money to buy additional organic chocolate/ coffee beans)

May 23: Hands on Activities (Kangaroos teach Koalas how to make Fruit Scrap Fertilizer; learn to make Organic Pesticide together)

May 24: Mainly Creative Writing

May 25: Presentation to ES



Please, note that FDIS covers the cost of the BIOFarm Field Trip. Families are asked to pay the cost of the Chocolate Factory Trip (see the plan for the prices). I am going to send you the Field Trips Permission Slip form next week.



Have a great weekend!



Sincerely,

Ms.L
