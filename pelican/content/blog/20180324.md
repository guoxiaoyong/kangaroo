## Earth Hour: Switch Off on March 24 at 8:30 pm

Dear Families,



As one of the skills for Quarter 3 is to identify a way you can help improve at least your local community, we cannot help but take part in celebrating Earth Hour by switching electricity off on March 24 at 8:30 pm. Kindly support your child in having activities that do not require using electricity for one hour this Saturday. Please, take a photo of your child celebrating Earth Hour. Every student is asked to make a poster using the photo(s). A poster sample is attached.



For more information, please, use the link:

Looking forward in getting all the marvelous posters on March 26th!



Change Climate Change Together :-)



Sincerely,

Ms.L
