## Wearing Book Week Costumes on March 30th

Dear Families,



I am writing a reminder that it is our annual Book Week celebration on March 30th. Families will be invited to school to celebrate. We will finalize details soon!



The tradition is for children to come dressed as their favorite book characters. Please, start to prepare a costume. It can be bought or made.



Looking forward to meeting all the different book characters on March 30th!



Sincerely,

Ms.L on behalf of Ms.Alexis
