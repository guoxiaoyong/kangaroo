## Wearing Book Week Costumes on March 30th

Dear Families,



I am writing a reminder that it is our annual Book Week celebration on March 30th. Families will be invited to school to celebrate. We will finalize details soon!



The tradition is for children to come dressed as their favorite book characters. Please, start to prepare a costume. It can be bought or made.



Looking forward to meeting all the different book characters on March 30th!



Sincerely,

Ms.L on behalf of Ms.Alexis

## Book Week Picnic: March 30th, Friday, 2:00 - 3:00 pm

Dear Families,



The Book Week Picnic is going to happen from 2:00 to 3:00 at our campus. Kindly bring a book, rug, and snack. Please, write an email to natalya_fdis@rambler.ru if you or anyone from your family is NOT coming on Friday. It will allow us to set a job for your child to be busy with or get to sit with another family.



In case AQI is too high or it is raining, Kangaroos (both Families and children) move to Room A114 to enjoy picnic in our classroom.



Looking forward to meeting lots of students dressed up as their favorite book characters. Your child should be ready to say a couple of facts about their character!



Your continuous support is greatly appreciated.



Sincerely,

Ms.L
