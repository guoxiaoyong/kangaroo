If there is a concern over your child's progress in any related subject , you will receive a Progress Report prior to the Report Card, from the teacher before the end of next week.



I hope this gives you ample time to take time off to meet with your child's teacher. 

The document with the links is also listed in the attachment.



Have a good day. 

Kind regards, 

Ms. Natasha D'Costa 

Head of Elementary School.
