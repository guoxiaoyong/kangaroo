## Rube Goldberg Awesome Machines by Masami and Tanya

Dear Families,



Some Kangaroos presented their Rube Goldberg Machines today. Kindly see two of the best videos attached. 



Every student is asked to present a video of his/ her Rube Goldberg machine that has 3-5 simple machines working together. Tomorrow is the last day to do so. Some of the students decided to make a better Rube Goldberg machine and present the video tomorrow, on March 6th.



Looking forward to watching the remaining videos in class tomorrow. Please, send the video on a USB or via email: natalya_fdis@rambler.ru



Thank you for your support!



Sincerely,

Ms.L
